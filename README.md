### Explanation of Key Markdown Elements:

- **Headers** (`#` to `######`) for organizing sections.
- **Bold Text** (`**text**`) for emphasis.
- **Code Blocks** (```language code```) for syntax-highlighted code snippets.
- **Lists** (`-`, `*`, or numbered `1.`) for bullet points and ordered lists.
- **Links** (`[link text](URL)`) to provide resources and references.
- **Horizontal Rule** (`---`) for visual separation.

This Markdown format would serve well as a README for GitHub or project documentation for UniScript. Let me know if you need additional sections or further customization!
